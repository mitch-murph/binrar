This project involves developing a single program with two intended users, 
i.e., teachers and student. The teacher's run time mode will have complete 
control over the program, whereas the student's version mode will have 
limited control like view their assessments and grades. This is anticipated 
to secure the files from being forged, safeguarded through encryption. 
Similarly, this project also involves compressing the assessment files 
to save cost and memory space.
